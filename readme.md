If you're planning to use this you need to install the dependencies or you'll encounter an error if you try to run it.

heres a step by step on what you need to install in the client and server side file.


CLIENT SIDE

Step 1: navigate to the client file in the terminal or in the VScode terminal by doing "cd client".

Step 2: Install the react library by typing "npm install".

Step 3: download the other dependencies by typing 
"npm i axios react-router-dom react-icons react-toastify".

NOTE: YOU CAN INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES IN THE STEP 3 INDIVIDUALLY BY
TYPING "npm i axios" but i prefer to install them all in one go.


SERVER SIDE

Step 1: Navigate to the server file and type "npm init -y" (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE INSTALLED NODE.JS BEFORE DOING THIS).

Step 2: Install the other dependencies used in the server side by typing 
"npm i bcrypt3.0 cors express cookie-parser jsonwebtoken moment multer mysql nodemon".

NOTE: AGAIN YOU CAN INSTALL THEM INDIVIDUALLY BUT I PREFER TO INSTALL THEM ALL IN ONE GO AND YOU CAN DO "npm install" instead of "npm i". There isn't really a difference but "i" was just a shortcut for "install".

NOTE 2: YOU CAN ALSO USE "yarn i (dependencies name)" or "yarn install (dependencies name).
