If you're planning to use this, you need to install the dependencies, or you'll encounter an error if you try to run it.

Here's a step-by-step on what you need to install in the client and server side files.

BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE STEP-BY-STEP INSTALLATION, YOUR MACHINE MUST HAVE NODE.JS INSTALLED BEFORE FOLLOWING THE STEPS BELOW.

YOU CAN VERIFY IF YOU HAVE NODE INSTALLED BY CHECKING IT IN THE TERMINAL BY TYPING "node -v".



CLIENT SIDE

Step 1: Navigate to the client file in the terminal or in the VSCode terminal by doing "cd client".

Step 2: Install the React library by typing "npm install".

Step 3: Download the other dependencies by typing "npm i axios react-router-dom react-icons react- toastify".


NOTE: YOU CAN INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES IN STEP 3 INDIVIDUALLY BY TYPING "npm i axios", BUT I PREFER TO INSTALL THEM ALL IN ONE GO.




SERVER SIDE

Step 1: Navigate to the server file and type "npm init -y".

Step 2: Install the other dependencies used in the server side by typing "npm i bcrypt cors express cookie-parser jsonwebtoken moment multer mysql nodemon".


NOTE: AGAIN, YOU CAN INSTALL THEM INDIVIDUALLY, BUT I PREFER TO INSTALL THEM ALL IN ONE GO. 

NOTE 2: YOU CAN DO "npm install" INSTEAD OF "npm i". THERE ISN'T REALLY A DIFFERENCE, BUT "i" WAS JUST A SHORTCUT FOR "install".

NOTE 3: YOU CAN ALSO USE "yarn add [dependency name]".
